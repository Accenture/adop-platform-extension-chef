# Chef Server Platform Extension
This extension will extend your platform with the Chef Server 12.

The following additional Chef features are free for up to 25 nodes:

* High Availability. Ensure that your Chef service is uninterrupted within your data center or AWS region, even if a Chef server fails.
* Reporting. Capture and visualize what happens during the execution of chef-client runs across all of your Chef-managed infrastructure.
* Management Console. Use the web-based management console to manage RBAC, edit and delete nodes, and reset private keys. Keep up to date with whatâ€™s happening during chef client runs across an entire organization or on specific nodes.
* Analytics Platform. Get visibility into your Chef servers, verify compliance and keep up with changes, all with the Chef analytics platform.

Open source features beyond Chef server core include:

* Push Jobs. Execute commands across hundreds or even thousands of nodes in your Chef-managed infrastructure.
